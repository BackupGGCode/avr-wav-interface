# avr-wav-interface
A lot of projects need sound capabilities of communication with the environment. Sometimes it is necessary, and sometimes an additional functionality(for fun). This project is a quick and inexpensive solution to this problem.

## GOALS ##

1. Maximum simple and ship solution base on ship AVR controller.

2. Simple interface
> a. For master controller like LCD communication (4 or 8 bit parallel connection)

> b. Simple interface like buttons triggers.

> c. Two voltage range: 3,3V or 5V

3. Support FAT16 or RAW data on SD card.

4. Support 11,025Hz 8bit PCM format

and more:

5. Support play two WAVs in the same time

6. Support play with loop.
